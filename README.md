I thought it would be cool to create a personal assistant. I create a basic framework for a Jarvis-like assistant that leverages OpenCV for computer vision tasks alongside other functionalities like speech recognition and synthesis. Adjust and expand based on your specific requirements and preferences.
The features I want to have are:
        Recognize spoken voice (Speech recognition)
        Answer in spoken voice (Text to speech)
        Answer simple commands

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
        Make sure you have Python installed along with OpenCV and any necessary libraries. You can install OpenCV using pip:
        pip install opencv-python


Step 2: Build Basic Functionality
Create a Python script (jarvis.py, for example) where you'll define functions for your assistant's tasks. These tasks could include:
     Voice Input and Output: Use a library like pyttsx3 for text-to-speech and speech_recognition for speech recognition.
     Image/Video Processing: Use OpenCV for tasks like face detection, object recognition, etc.

Step 3: Adding Assistant Features
Integrate OpenCV operations with other functionalities like speech recognition. For instance, you could use speech recognition to trigger image processing tasks based on voice commands.
